Tank Boat
 
We intended our project to be a functioning remote controlled boat that had a tank head on top of the boat that could swivel and the barrel could move vertically and shoot lasers. We chose th8is project because we enjoyed making hardware and wanted to make a vehicle that could run off a remote and an RC car seemed too basic and not cool enough. 
We Developed our project in three different parts: the 3D printed hull and tank, the code, and the circuitry. We used 2 arduinos and breadboards for the circuitry. We created 3D objects in tinkercad, then imported them to afinia and printed them through a 3D printer. We coded the project using arduino code. We used tinkercad to design the 3D objects because it was simple and free. We used arduinos for the project because we were familiar with them and they were readily available for the class. We faced the challenge of getting necessary components like water proofing paint, popsicle sticks, and a tub for the boat. Also, the 3D printer broke while we were working on the project and we had to wait for that to be fixed. Here's a link for the wiki:

The wiki includes our process of creating the TankBoat and is organized weekly.
 
Our finished project uses paddles made of plastic spoons and plastic tires with holes drilled for spoons, these run off motors. The tank head and barrel are controlled by servos hot glued to popsicle sticks. The hull is 3D printed and hot glued together, Everything is painted with acrylic paint. The arduinos are placed into the boat. Underneath them is a ballast made from plastic bags of salt. Everything is controlled remotely from a HK-T6A V2 2.4Ghz remote.The boat is propelled by the paddles and can go forward, backward, or turn. The tank head swivels and the barrel moves vertically on the servos.   
 
 
Future development of this project would include adding a laser that could be controlled remotely and have more stable paddles that propel the boat smoothly. We wished to implement a laser but did not have enough time to add it to the TankBoat. These features were infeasible due to the short timespan we had to complete this project.
